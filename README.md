# Foreign Geo-Blocklist for Russia

A community-maintained list of domain names that are made inaccessible to users from the Russian Federation due to geoblocking policies implemented by foreign providers. This list aims to document instances where access to online resources is restricted *from* Russia by the resource owners, rather than by internal Russian regulations.

This list can be used by researchers, developers, and the general public to track and analyze the extent of such outbound restrictions.

## Blocked Domains

The list of blocked domains is maintained in the `domains.txt` file, with one domain per line.

**Example content of `domains.txt`:**
```
example.com
another-example.org
```

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` (to be added) for guidelines on how to submit new domains or update existing entries.
